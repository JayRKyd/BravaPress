## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Payment Integration Specifications

#### Stripe Configuration
```typescript
// Environment variables needed
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_... // $395 price
```

#### Payment Flow
1. User clicks "Pay Now" in press release form
2. Frontend creates payment intent via API
3. Stripe Elements handles payment collection
4. Webhook confirms payment success
5. Background job processes press release
6. Email confirmation sent to user

### Database Schema Updates

#### Transactions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  press_release_id UUID REFERENCES press_releases(id),
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL, -- in cents
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Press Release Updates
```sql
ALTER TABLE press_releases 
ADD COLUMN payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
ADD COLUMN transaction_id UUID REFERENCES transactions(id);
```

### Email Templates Required

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS TRACKING

### Daily Standup Questions
1. What critical tasks were completed yesterday?
2. What blockers are preventing progress?
3. What are the top 3 priorities for today?
4. Are we on track for the 2-week deadline?

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1**: Payment system functional, authentication fixed
- **Week 2**: Production deployment complete, full testing done

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully pay $395 for press releases
- [ ] Payment processing is fully automated
- [ ] EINPresswire submissions work reliably
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows real data
- [ ] Email notifications are sent
- [ ] System is deployed to production

## ðŸš¨ RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Stripe Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple payment intent flow
   - Fallback: Use Stripe Checkout (hosted solution)

2. **EINPresswire Automation Reliability**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive error handling already implemented
   - Fallback: Manual submission process for failures

3. **Production Deployment Issues**
   - Mitigation: Staging environment testing
   - Fallback: Rollback procedures prepared

### Contingency Plans
- If payment integration takes longer: Prioritize basic Stripe Checkout
- If automation fails: Implement manual review queue
- If deployment issues: Use development environment for initial launch
