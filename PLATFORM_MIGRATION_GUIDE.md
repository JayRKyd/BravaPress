# Platform Comparison: Why Railway/Render vs Vercel for BravaPress

## **The Core Issue with Vercel**

Your app uses **Playwright browser automation** to submit press releases to EIN Presswire. Vercel's serverless functions **cannot run browsers** - they're designed for lightweight API responses, not heavy automation tasks.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Your app works perfectly on Vercel (UI, database, APIs)
- ❌ **Automation fails** because browsers can't be installed
- ❌ **No background jobs** - serverless functions can't run continuously

## **Why Railway/Render Solve This**

### **Railway (Recommended)**

**✅ Benefits:**
- **Full Docker support** - Can install Playwright browsers
- **Background processes** - Runs your job scheduler 24/7
- **Simple deployment** - Connect GitHub, deploy automatically
- **Affordable** - $5/month for your use case
- **Real servers** - Not serverless limitations

**🚀 What This Enables:**
- ✅ Playwright automation works out of the box
- ✅ Jobs process automatically every minute
- ✅ Scheduled releases work perfectly
- ✅ No manual intervention needed

### **Render (Alternative)**

**✅ Benefits:**
- **Native Node.js support** - Handles Playwright well
- **Background services** - Built-in cron jobs
- **Free tier available** - Good for testing
- **Automatic deploys** - GitHub integration

## **Business Impact Comparison**

### **Current State (Vercel):**
```
User submits press release → Payment succeeds → Job created → ❌ STOPS
                                                             ↓
                                              Admin must manually process
```

### **With Railway/Render:**
```
User submits press release → Payment succeeds → Job created → ✅ AUTO PROCESSES
                                                             ↓
                                              Posted to EIN Presswire automatically
                                                             ↓
                                              Client gets confirmation email
```
